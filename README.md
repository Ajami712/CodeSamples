# CodeSamples
Various scripts I have written, featured here for easy browsing. I have selected scripts that highlight my experience with analyzing different types of biological data sets.

DE Analysis_GeneLevel_Annotated.R and GeneLevel_TrendsAcrossTime.R pertain to transcriptomic data analysis and include basic differential expression and visualization.
Mining_GENELINC_Interactions_5KB.R pertains to Hi-C data analysis and pinpointing interchromosomal interactions of interest.
Elasticnet_lipidomics.R pertains to lipidomics data analysis and building a logistic regression model to predict insulin resistance in patients.
Working with normalized and binned ChIP-seq data.ipynb pertains to ChIP-seq data analysis. This is proof-of-concept code that is written to display how ChIP-seq data sets can be compared to each other after standardizing them across genomic windows. It is a portion of a larger pipeline that will be detailed in an academic manuscript that is still in preparation.
